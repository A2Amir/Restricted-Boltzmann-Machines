Introduction

Restricted Boltzmann Machine RBMs are flat neural networks that learn to reconstruct data independently by themselves in an unsupervised fashion. It can automatically extract meaningful features by constructing and deconstructing from a given input.
How does it work?

RBM is a two-layer neural network. Simply put, RBM takes the input and translates it into a set of binary values representing it in the hidden layer. These numbers can then be retranslated to reconstruct the inputs. Multiple forward and backward passes train the RBM, and a trained RBM can reveal which features are most important in pattern recognition.
